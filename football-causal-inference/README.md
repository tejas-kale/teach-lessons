# Football Causal Inference

A 17-lesson path from causal questions to advanced longitudinal methods, using football applications throughout. Start with [Lesson 1](lessons/0001-from-question-to-estimand.html), take the lessons in order, and use the [glossary](reference/glossary.html) and [design field guide](reference/design-field-guide.html) for revision.

## How to use the course

1. State each answer before revealing quiz feedback.
2. Rewrite every worked example for a football question you care about.
3. Do not choose an estimator until you can name the estimand and identification assumptions.
4. Ask your teaching agent follow-up questions whenever a step is unclear.

## Evidence boundaries

The course found no strong standalone football paper for explicit DAG/back-door identification, longitudinal g-methods, target-trial emulation or standalone AIPW. Lessons 3, 4, 6 and 14 label their constructed scenarios accordingly. This is a limitation of the targeted source search, not proof that no such paper exists.
