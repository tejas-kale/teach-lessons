    <h2>How to use this sheet</h2>
    <p>Work through the questions in order and write your answers down before reading any part of the answer section. Give yourself about thirty minutes in total. If one question runs long, write what you have, mark it and move on, because the answer section explains the reasoning in full.</p>
    <p>Most questions ask for a short written answer rather than a number. The aim is a defensible statement, so a sentence or two of reasoning is worth more than a single word.</p>

Write your answers down rather than composing them in your head, because the difference between a vague sense of the argument and a defensible written statement is the thing these sheets are training. Mark yourself afterwards against the answer section, and note any question where your answer and the suggested answer disagreed for a reason you cannot articulate.</p>
